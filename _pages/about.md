About Me 

I have always been fascinated by the ingenious ways mathematics has been applied to real life problems, and have been awed by the ways electricity has been able to transform human life. This is majorly the reason for me to be currently pursuing a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, while simultaneously pursuing a minor in Finance. Over the course of the last few years, I have further developed a keen interest in Computational Finance, specifically using developments in machine learning for curated problems in financial domains.
