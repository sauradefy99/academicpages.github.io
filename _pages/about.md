Hi! I'm Souradeep Chakraborty, named Saura by friends and colleagues, a senior year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). I have always been fascinated by the ingenious ways mathematics has been applied to real life problems, and have been awed by the way electricity has been able to transform human life. Another specific application of mathematical abstraction that has always interested me is finance. This is the primary reason for me to be currently pursuing a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, while simultaneously pursuing a minor in Finance. Over the course of the last few years, I have further developed a keen interest in Computational Finance, specifically using developments in machine learning for [curated problems in financial domains](experience.md).
